A large pheasant-like bird. Male has a black face with dark blue cheeks and chin, and a grayish-brown back and uppertail. It has white speckling all over, but the male Satyr Tragopan is the only tragopan to have white dots on the red breast. Female is similar in shape, but all brown with thin white streaks on the back and reddish-brown wings. Found in dense forests, where it forages on the forest floor. The call is a nasal, wailing “gwaaahh.”

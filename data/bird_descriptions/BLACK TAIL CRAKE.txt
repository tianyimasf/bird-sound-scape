Small dark crake found in highlands and foothill regions, where it inhabits forested marshes, flooded fields, and wet shrubby patches. Rich brown above and dark gray below. Color scheme similar to Brown Crake, but darker overall, particularly on the face. Like most crakes, generally shy, preferring thick vegetation, but will venture into open fields and marshes during dawn and dusk. Voice consists of two hoarse croaks, followed by a clattering descending trill.

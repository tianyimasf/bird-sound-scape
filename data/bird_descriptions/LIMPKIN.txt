Large heronlike bird, reminiscent of a gangly ibis but more closely related to rails. Brown with white spots and streaks, densest on the head and neck. Long yellowish bill is slightly decurved. Found in marshes or swamps, often with trees and shrubs, but also regularly seen at the edges of ponds in otherwise highly managed city parks. Feeds almost exclusively on apple snails. Usually single or in pairs. Distinctive voice is a loud, creaky wail, often heard as an eerie jungle sound effect in films.

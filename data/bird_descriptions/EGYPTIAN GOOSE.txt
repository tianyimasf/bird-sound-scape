This striking “goose” (in actuality more closely related to shelducks) is native to Africa, mainly the eastern and southern parts of the continent; it has also been introduced widely across Europe and parts of the U.S. Distinctive: note the staring pale eye surrounded by a dark patch, pink legs, and overall gray and buffy plumage. In flight, look for bright white forewings. Usually found in pairs or family groups. Feeds while swimming and by grazing on shore.

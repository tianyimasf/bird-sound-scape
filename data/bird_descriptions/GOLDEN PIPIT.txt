An unusual pipit of dry country. Breeding males are spectacular, with yellow underparts, a black chest band, and yellow wings with black tips. Non-breeding males and females are much duller, though they still have a yellow wash to the underparts and along the edges of the wing and outer tail feathers. Found in dry savanna. Wanders widely, and most likely to be seen after rains. Feeds on the ground, but often perches in bushes. Breeding male recalls a longclaw, but is easily separated by the yellow wing. Females and non-breeding males can be confused with other pipits and longclaws, but are smaller, and can still be distinguished by yellow in the wing and tail. The song consists of scratchy whistles.

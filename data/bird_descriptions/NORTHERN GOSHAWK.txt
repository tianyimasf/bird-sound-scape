Powerfully-built forest-dwelling hawk, scarce across much of range. Adults are distinctive if seen well: bulky and broad-winged, gray above and whitish below with fine barring, prominent pale eyebrow, and dark reddish eye. Immature very similar to Cooper's Hawk, but larger and more powerful, with broader wings and tail, usually more obvious pale eyebrow (but Cooperâ€™s can have this, too!), and heavy streaking below extending onto undertail coverts. In most suburban areas, Cooper's is much more likely; goshawk typically requires extensive mature forest. Very aggressive around the nest. Feeds on large prey such as hares and grouse.

Medium-sized, stocky parrot that is distinctive even under poor lighting conditions; note black cap and contrasting white-and-yellow pattern on face, breast, and belly. Common in a variety of forest types, especially those on sandy soils. Usually seen in groups of 4-5 or more. Groups forage quietly on fruit and flowers in forest canopy, flushing noisily with distinctive whirring wingbeats that are audible at some distance. Flight call is a penetrating screech, somewhat similar to Red-fan Parrot but higher-pitched and less variable.

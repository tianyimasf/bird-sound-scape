Noisy lapwing with a large yellow wattle across forehead and hanging over the bill. Two subspecies: southern “Black-shouldered” subspecies has a black shoulder band (not meeting in middle as on Banded Lapwing) and a larger black cap. Northern subspecies lacks black shoulder band and has a larger yellow wattle. Only “Black-shouldered” subspecies occurs in New Zealand. Abundant in most open country, being a common feature of urban parks, sporting fields, paddocks, riverbeds, wetlands, and coastal habitats.

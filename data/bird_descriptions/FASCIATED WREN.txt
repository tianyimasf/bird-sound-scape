Large, noisy wren of dry and semi-humid areas; ranges from western Ecuador south to central Peru. Upperparts, sides, and tail are boldly barred with gray and white, and breast is spotted with gray. Similar to Band-backed Wren, but lacks chestnut on underparts, has paler breast spots, and prefers more arid habitats. Pairs or small groups forage conspicuously in bushes and trees, giving a variety of harsh, raspy calls.

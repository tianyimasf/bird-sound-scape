Uncommon and unobtrusive, this chunky and mostly chestnut-colored bird is unlike any other whistling-thrush. Male has a dark blue head with an iridescent forehead, while the female has a brownish head. Both sexes have an iridescent blue patch on the shoulder which is only occasionally visible. Endemic to Sumatra’s foothill forests (400-1500 meters), often found close to shaded forest streams. Shy, but sometimes perches up on rocks and branches. Gives a loud “nyaaah” and a series of low buzzy notes.

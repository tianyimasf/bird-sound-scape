Strikingly beautiful white manakin with a red crown and black tail and flight feathers. Females are olive-green, paler below; note the short crest above the bill. Has a tiny geographic range on the borders of the Araripe Plateau, where it is found in woodland near water. Has a pleasant call “guru-uí”, similar to Helmeted Manakin calls.

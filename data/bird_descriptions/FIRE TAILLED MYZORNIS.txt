Uncommon but unmistakable inhabitant of middle- to high-altitude thickets. Bright green with fiery red tail edges, an orange throat, a black line through the eye, and flashing white dots on the wingtips. Females are slightly duller than males but are otherwise similar. Never in large numbers; usually seen singly, occasionally in pairs and trios. Often joins mixed-species foraging flocks.

Large, colorful barbet with a huge ivory-colored bill. Note the red underparts with a thick black bar across the middle. Found in a variety of habitats, including moist and dry savanna, woodland, gardens, and secondary growth, often in the vicinity of figs and other fruiting trees. Most often in pairs or small groups. The call is a very rough, explosive “rwauk,” often given in a slow series. Similar to Double-toothed Barbet, but separated by the black chest band and the lack of a red bar on the shoulder.

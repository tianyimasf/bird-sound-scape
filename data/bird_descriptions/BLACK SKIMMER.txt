Unusual tern-like bird with oversized billâ€”lower mandible is much longer than upper mandible. Feeds by flying close to surface of water and dipping its lower mandible into the water "skimming" for small fish. Found coastally, especially beaches and sandbars. Barking "yip" calls might clue you in to a flock in flight.

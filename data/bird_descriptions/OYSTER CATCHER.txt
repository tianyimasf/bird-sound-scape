Large, bulky shorebird with thick red bill. Unmistakable, striking plumage. Exclusively coastal; favors beaches where it feeds on shellfish and other invertebrates; less frequent in rocky areas. Gathers in flocks during migration and winter. Listen for loud yelps and whistles, often in a rapid series when excited. Hybrids with Black Oystercatcher occur locally in southern California and Baja; look for messy spotting where the black hood meets the white belly (sometimes very limited but often quite extensive).

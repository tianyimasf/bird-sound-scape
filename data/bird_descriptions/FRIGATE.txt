A huge black bird with a very long hooked bill and a long, trailing deeply forked tail. Soars on giant wings, often harassing other birds to steal their food. Male is entirely black with a limited red throat. Female is black with a wide reddish chest band. Almost identical to Magnificent Frigatebird, but slightly smaller, with a more limited red throat patch. Lacks the pale upperwing panel of Great Frigatebird. Female is the only entirely dark female frigatebird; reddish chest band is diagnostic. Mostly pelagic.

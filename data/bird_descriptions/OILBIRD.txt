This bizarre nocturnal fruit-eating bird is unlikely to be mistaken. It is entirely rufous-brown with small white spots on the wings, tail, and body. The pinkish bill is strongly hooked. Sexes similar. Breeds and roosts in colonies in caves or steep dark ravines. Difficult to find away from a known colony. Occasionally seen flying over the forest canopy at dawn or dusk, when it can be told from other crepuscular birds like nighthawks by its larger size, bulkier shape, and floppier flight style. Occurs from the lowlands up into the subtropical zone in the Andes, occasionally straying even higher. Makes a variety of strange clicking and shrieking noises.

Famously loud and distinctive-looking, this large cotinga is one of the iconic species of northern South America. Male is unmistakable with mostly white body, black wings, brown head, and throat full of dangling black wattles that look like the bird threw up a plateful of worms onto itself. Female is much plainer, greenish with faint yellow streaks on the underparts. Female is extremely similar to female White Bellbird; where range overlaps with White Bellbird, Bearded typically occurs at higher elevations. Most often found by the extremely loud and far-carrying “bonk!” call given by the male.

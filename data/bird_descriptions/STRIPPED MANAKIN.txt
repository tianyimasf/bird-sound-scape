Chunky little, short-tailed bird of lowland and foothill forest. Male is distinctive with bright red crown and bold white stripes on reddish belly. Female lacks red crown but shows faint streaking on sides unlike any other manakin. Inconspicuous; elaborate display dance infrequently seen. Found in the lower to middle levels of forest. Listen for its high-pitched, quiet, whistled “ch-peew” song across much of range.

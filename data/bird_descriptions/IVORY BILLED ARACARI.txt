Small toucan found in western Amazonia. Unlikely to be confused in range. Look for its red breast, dark belly band, and yellow lower belly. The bill is mostly pale creamy-yellow, with variable dark markings. Typically found in pairs or small groups in the canopy of lowland forest and edges, up into the foothills of the Andes. Often seen perched conspicuously on a snag, or foraging in a fruiting tree.

Fairly large and strikingly-plumaged woodpecker with a yellow-crested head contrasting with a largely black body which is variably scaled with yellow spots depending on the subspecies, and a yellow rump. Males have a red moustache. Found in both wet and dry forests, usually avoiding the interior, and in wooded savannas.

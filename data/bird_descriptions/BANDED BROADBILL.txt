Deep purplish-red broadbill with bold yellow patches on the wings and tail. Broad-based bill and irises are bright blue. Female is slightly duller than the male, and lacks a black line across the chest. Favors riparian and wet forests from the lowlands up into montane areas, and will visit edges, gardens, and parks. Forages in the canopy, often flying from a perch to do so. More vocal than Black-and-yellow Broadbill, giving long, drawn-out whistles and buzzing trills.

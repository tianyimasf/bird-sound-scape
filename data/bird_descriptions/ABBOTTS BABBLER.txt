Plain, sandy-brown babbler with distinct orange-tan tones to the sides. Note grayish tones to the face and the large heavy bill with a hooked tip. Prefers degraded and secondary forest, where it forages quite slowly and methodically on or near the ground, without the frenetic energy of some other babblers. Moves singly or in pairs. Call repertoire is wide, and includes harsh churrs as well as smooth whistles. Song consists of melodic whistles, usually 3-4 notes.

Fairly common to common in native temperate forest, adjacent shrubbery, wooded patches, and thickets along rivers and streams, especially with bamboo. Loud ringing song is commonly heard, but calling birds can be elusive. At other times can be confiding, walking out at close range as if curious, usually with tail cocked. Plumage distinctive, with bright rusty eyebrow, throat, and breast. Compare with the larger and fatter Chestnut-throated Huet-huet.

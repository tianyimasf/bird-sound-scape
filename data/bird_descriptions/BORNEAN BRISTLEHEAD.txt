A “grail bird” of many birders visiting Borneo, this unique and unmistakable bird with an incandescent head looks like a cross between a small crow and a brightly-colored tube sock. Dark and heavy hooked bill gives it a top-heavy appearance. Often encountered in small flocks as it hops about in the canopy of primary dipterocarp and peatswamp forest in lowland and foothill areas. Vocal, frequently giving bursts of chattering notes, as well as nasal whines and whistles.

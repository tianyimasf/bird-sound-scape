Large and impressive raptor with a range encompassing much of the Northern Hemisphere. Mostly dark brown; the namesake golden nape can be hard to see, especially from below. Immatures have a white patch on the underwing and a white tail base. Compared to similar immature sea eagles such as White-tailed and Bald Eagle, lacks significant white mottling on the belly. Also note the relatively short-necked profile. Often holds wings in slight V-shape when soaring. Hunts mainly mammals in remote, open country from grasslands and steppes to mountainous areas.

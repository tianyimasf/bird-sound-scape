Medium-sized plover endemic to Australia, inhabiting arid, inland areas. Favors flat, open landscapes, usually with scattered, short vegetation. Inconspicuous during the day, this species is more obvious at night when feeding on insects. Often seen next to inland roads. Orange-brown underparts and black streaky patterning on upperparts, with white rump, vertical black line through the eye, and distinctive “Y”-shaped breast marking (less obvious in juvenile).

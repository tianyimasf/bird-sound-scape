Fairly large lory of lowlands and foothill forest and edge. Mainly dark plumage, with 2 obvious bands across the chest and a red bill. Coloration varies from yellow to red. In flight, bright yellow patch in the wing is highly visible. Distinctive fast and straight flight. Often seen flying high in large flocks. Somewhat similar to Black, Brown and Yellow-streaked Lories, but Dusky has a red rather than black bill and different flight. Coconut Lorikeet shows bright red in the fore wing. Very vocal. Noisy, high-pitch, ringing screeches.

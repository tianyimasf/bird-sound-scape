Always a fan favorite; known for its flame-orange throat that seems to glow even through fog and rain. Triangular black cheek patch and oddly shaped white wing patch are also distinctive. Females and immatures are washed-out versions of malesâ€”look for yellowish throat and triangular dark cheek patch. Prefers coniferous or mixed forests, but can be found in any wooded habitat during migration. Winters in mountains of northern South America. Forages for insects, often near treetops.

A small though long-tailed hornbill that is frequently encountered as it flies singly or in groups over the canopy, between forest gaps, and over road cuts. Distinctive, with a bright white belly and a black head, body, wings, and tail, giving it a bicolored appearance. Similar to Congo Pied Hornbill, but usually separated by range, and the tail has white corners (rather than edges), and the bill is pale yellow with a black (rather than red) tip. Calls are a series of high-pitched whistles: “heu heu heu heu.”

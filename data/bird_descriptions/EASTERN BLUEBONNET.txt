Brown parrot with yellow-and-red belly and deep blue face, typically found in dry inland habitats in eastern Australia. Multiple subspecies vary in the color of their wing patch, belly, and undertail. Usually seen in small groups, this species is often hard to approach and is easily flushed. In flight, the blue wings and red shoulders contrast with pale brown back. Distinguished from the similar but smaller Naretha Bluebonnet by presence of red on belly.

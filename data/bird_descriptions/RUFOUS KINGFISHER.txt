Tiny, unbelievably cute kingfisher: a luminous ball of pink, orange, yellow, and varying amounts of blue and purple. Brightly-colored back distinguishes this species from closely related Black-backed Dwarf-Kingfisher. Forages in shaded patches of dense vegetation, in mangroves, overgrown edge, or deep lowland and foothill forest. Can be near or away from water; when near water, often near shallow forest streams and small pools. Gives high squeaks and thin whistles, often as paired notes.

Small whistling-duck with strongly pale-spotted neck and flanks, dark bill, and gray face. Similar to Wandering Whistling-Duck, but lacks warm rusty coloring, and has pale-spotted rather than dark-spotted breast. Found in small flocks in coastal wetlands and lagoons. Australia range slowly expanding southwards from Cape York region, with regular records now from the Wet Tropics.

A light brown, medium-sized vulture. It has whitish feathers on a dark head and neck, a pale bill, and a pale collar which is more prominent behind the neck. The juvenile has a dark bill, more white feathering on the head and neck, and browner plumage overall, with pale streaks on breast and belly. In flight, note the pale underparts and underwing contrasting with the dark flight feathers. The species nests in colonies on cliffs and ruins, and occasionally in trees. Similar to Slender-billed Vulture, but Indian Vultures are not as lanky and have a paler bill and very tiny ear holes.

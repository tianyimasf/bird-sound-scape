A neon-colored, noisy, highly social bird of lowland and mid-altitude subtropical forests. Surprisingly difficult to spot as it glides from tree to tree in the middle and upper levels of the forest. Memorable if seen well: bright green with chestnut-tipped wings, a black mask, and a coral-red bill. Similar Indochinese Green-Magpie is yellower-toned and paler-eyed, and lacks the black-and-white “lattice” of feathers on the rear tip of the wings. Gives a series of piercing shrieks followed by a hollow and decisive-sounding “chup” note.

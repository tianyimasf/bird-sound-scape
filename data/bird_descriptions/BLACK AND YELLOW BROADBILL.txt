Utterly unmistakable in its costume of black, white, yellow, and pink. Wide, deep-based bill, typical of the broadbills, is bright blue. Forages at middle to high levels in lowland and hill forests, frequently moving with mixed-species flocks and sallying out from a perch. Song is disproportionately loud, a series of high-pitched coos that increases in pitch and speed, turning into a maddened series of loud whistles. Frequently gives a jay-like “jeer!” call.

A large-bodied, small-headed, slaty-gray gamebird perfectly lined with rows of hundreds of white spots. The distinctive head sports a strange bone-like casque and naked warty facial skin, which is colored white, blue, or red depending on geographic location. Young birds are brown and are almost always found with adults. It is common throughout its range, and large flocks roam the savannas, digging for invertebrates and tubers. Guineafowl often behave like lunatics, charging around issuing a loud and distinctive “kek-kek-kek-kraaaaaaah” alarm. It also calls a distinctive, plaintive “kuuuh-keeerk”. Crested Guineafowl differ from Helmeted Guineafowl by being darker and having a plumed crest on top of the head.

A brightly-colored and well-marked woodpecker of high-altitude Himalayan foothill forests. Similar to Great Spotted Woodpecker but with a densely-streaked yellowish belly and pale yellow-orange on the neck and throat. Males have a bright red patch on the back of the crown which females lack. Like other large black-and-white woodpeckers, usually seen singly or in pairs, drumming away on tree trunks.

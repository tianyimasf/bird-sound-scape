Eccentric-looking hornbill with a bushy, upright white crest and a white tail. Male is white from the head down to the belly; female is predominantly black, with only a white crest. Pale wing edges revealed only when in flight. Unlike many other hornbills in its range, forages primarily at lower levels in the forest, frequently descending down to the ground. Social; forages in flocks. Gives rather soothing, owl-like hooting coos.

Typical, heavy-billed raven, but with the unusual addition of a white wedge on the back of the neck. Flight is powerful and heavy; sometimes soars. Found in a variety of habitats in rocky or mountainous country. Usually in pairs or small flocks; feeds by walking along the ground. Call is a rough “krrraw.” Larger than Pied Crow, with a heavier bill and much less white. Similar to Thick-billed Raven, but shorter-tailed, smaller-billed, and with a more extensive white patch on the neck.

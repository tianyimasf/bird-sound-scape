Big, dark, long-tailed tree-dwelling bird. Like other couas, inquisitive and restless. Generally prefers to jump or flop through the trees, but sometimes makes long gliding flights with occasional explosive wingbeats. Found in eastern and northern rainforest. Most common call is a short, explosive “brr-dd-t”. Also gives a long, descending series of mournful “kwa” notes. Larger than Red-fronted and Red-breasted Couas, lacking red coloration, and is usually found high in trees, unlike those understory-dwelling species.

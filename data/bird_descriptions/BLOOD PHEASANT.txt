A chunky partridgelike pheasant of montane scrub. Males are silvery gray with extensive pale streaking all over the body and crimson-tinged face, tail, breast, and tail - the namesake “blood” of this species. Female is warm brown with an orange face. Both sexes have a small head with an occasionally raised weak crest. Usually seen in small flocks in the winter and in pairs or singly in the summer.

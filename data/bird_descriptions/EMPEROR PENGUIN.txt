Truly a royal and commanding presence, this largest of the penguins is seldom seen away from Antarctica and its surrounding seas, though young birds do disperse beyond the pack ice. Immense size and unique coloration readily distinguish this species from most other penguins; King Penguin is similar in patterning, but is smaller, longer-billed, less bulky overall, and has brighter and more extensive orange markings on the head. Breeds in immense colonies on the ice, with males famously spending months tending to the egg. Gives impressive trumpeting cries, especially during courtship.

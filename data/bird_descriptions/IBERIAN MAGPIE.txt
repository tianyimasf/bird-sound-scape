Unmistakable magpie with a black cap, sandy-brown body, white throat, blue wings, and long blue tail. Highly gregarious, gathers in noisy family flocks giving repetitive “krrr-krrr” calls interspersed with rattles. Usually found in open woodlands with grassy clearings, including orchards and olive groves, but prefers oak woodlands.

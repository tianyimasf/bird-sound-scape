Slim pretty bee-eater with very long central tail feathers. The bold white throat and eyebrow distinguish this species from all other bee-eaters. Breeds in arid savanna, but occurs in a wide range of habitats on migration and when not breeding, including moist savanna, forest edge, and cultivation. Often in groups, which are sometimes large. The call is a dry, high-pitched rattle.

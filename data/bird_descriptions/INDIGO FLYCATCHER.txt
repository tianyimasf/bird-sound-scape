Beautiful little gem of a flycatcher. Note small dark mask, whitish belly, and iridescent aquamarine blaze on the forehead. Sexes similar. Immature birds are patchy-looking, with pale buffy spots scattered throughout the body. Compare with other blue flycatchers; note present species’ mask, size, and white belly. Forages at all levels of montane forest, often descending close to the ground or perching on posts and stumps close to paths. Can be quite tame and friendly, tolerating close approach. Joins mixed flocks. Song is a halting up-and-down series of high-pitched whistles. Calls include a dry chatter and harsh “tchak” calls.

Large raptor. Appears dark from a distance. Up close, dark brown above with bare red head. In flight, undersides of wings are two-toned; lighter on the entire trailing edge of the wing, opposed to just wingtips on Black Vulture. Wings are held slightly raised when soaring, making a "V" when seen head-on. Tends to wobble in flight. Wingbeats slower and deeper than Black Vulture. Glides relatively low while sniffing for carrion, or riding thermals to higher vantage points. Also huddles around roadkill or dumpsters.

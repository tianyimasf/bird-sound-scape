Medium-sized sluggish flycatcher of riverine and disturbed habitats. Key marks are entirely cinnamon plumage and large-headed, plain-faced appearance; bill seems heavy and is entirely black. Sits still, peering about, before sallying to foliage for insects. Inhabits mid-story and understory, often at forest edge. Found in forest along rivers and oxbow lakes, in abandoned plantations, and at savanna edges, usually near water. Similar to Dull-capped Attila but has dark eyes and different voice. Most common calls are various mournful whistles.

Large, bizarre bird of tall rainforest. Unmistakable even when seen briefly, as they often are, flying quickly across roads or rivers. Appears broad-winged and mostly burnt orange with a disproportionately small head. Feeds on fruit in the forest canopy. Far-carrying display call of lekking males is one of the strangest avian sounds, similar to a distant chain saw or cow; males on leks can seem almost oblivious to human observers.

Large, boldly marked, and boisterous flycatcher. Rather stocky with large head and short tail. Looks bright and contrasty with yellow belly, black-and-white head pattern, and rufous wings and tail. Common and widespread throughout Middle and South America, with limited range in the U.S. (Texas). Occurs in shrubby woodlands, often near clearings or bodies of water. Listen for loud “kis-ka-dee” calls, which helps separate from similar species like Lesser Kiskadee and Boat-billed Flycatcher.

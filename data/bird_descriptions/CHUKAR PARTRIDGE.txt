Boldly-patterned quail-like bird, often in small flocks on dry rocky slopes with sparse grass and brush. Male and female similar. Overall pale sandy brownish-gray with bold black stripe on the face. Also look for red bill and legs and black stripes on sides. Usually seen scurrying around on the ground, but males perch conspicuously when singing, often on large rocks. Song is a series of scratchy notes; sounds like it’s saying its name with emphasis on the second syllable: “chuKAR, chuKAR, chuKAR.” Native to Asia and the Middle East, where range barely overlaps with any similar species; note creamy throat to help separate from Rock Partridge. Introduced and well-established in western North America, New Zealand, and Hawaii; escaped cage birds or hunting stock can occur elsewhere.

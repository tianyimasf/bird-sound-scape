A plump, small robin, gray above and bright yellow below. Dark gray in the area between the bill and eye (lores), unlike similar Pale-yellow Robin. Perches on low branches and on the side of tree trunks, from which it drops to the ground to capture prey. Inhabits forests of eastern Australia. Voice is a slow, repetitive whistle. Also gives a loud double whistle, worth learning.

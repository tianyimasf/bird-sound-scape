A large, chunky, long-tailed rock-thrush. The male has a brown back and uniform blue-gray coloration restricted to the head and throat. The female is differentiated from other rock-thrushes by her shape and rich buff underparts broken only by a small white patch on the central throat. Pairs and small groups occupy rocky areas in grassland, semi-arid country, and fynbos (heath). The species has also adapted to human-modified landscapes, breeding on buildings in hamlets surrounded by vegetation. Other male rock-thrushes have blue-gray backs.

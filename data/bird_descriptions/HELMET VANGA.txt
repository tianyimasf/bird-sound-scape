Huge black vanga with a rufous back and an enormous blue bill. Rare and localized Madagascar endemic that is found in northeastern rainforest at low and middle elevations. Usually in the mid-story, perching motionless for long periods. Often joins flocks with other large vangas. Most easily located when nesting in a large mossy cup that is placed on a forking mid-story branch. Song is a long, delicate, high-pitched, slightly descending trill.

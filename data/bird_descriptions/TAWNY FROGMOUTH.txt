Australia’s most familiar nocturnal bird. Note bright yellow eye and very large ‘frog-like’ bill with whiskers above only slightly banded. A master of camouflage, its shaggy plumage blends in with rough bark when roosting. Usually gray but some subspecies appear more rusty-colored. Present in a wide variety of habitats and common in suburban areas.

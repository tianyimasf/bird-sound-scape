All-dark passerine that inhabits only fast-moving rocky streams in the West, from Alaska to Panama. Slaty gray overall with browner head. Forages for invertebrates by walking underwater. Unique shape, behavior, and strict habitat preferences make dipper unlikely to be confused with other species. Often nests under bridges.

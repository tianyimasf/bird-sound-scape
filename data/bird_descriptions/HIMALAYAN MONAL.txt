Decked out in all the colors of the rainbow, the male is the image of iridescence; green crested head, red neck, green shoulders, blue back, orange tail, and black underparts. When displaying or flushed, flashes a bright white patch on the back. Female is nowhere near as brightly-colored, with a pale blue eye patch, white throat, and streaky brown body. Found in Himalayan hill forest, typically in areas with extensive rhododendron and bamboo-dominated understory.

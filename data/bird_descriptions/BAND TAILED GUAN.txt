A pale-faced and short-crested guan with a red throat and dark brown body with contrasting fine white streaks. Face markings are distinctive: has a long pale eyebrow and whitish moustache and cheeks; also shows bare bluish gray skin around the eye and a dull rufous tipped tail. Sexes similar. Common in the canopy of cloud forest, generally in groups resting or foraging for fruits. Often very quiet, but easy to see when flying awkwardly from a tree or vocalizing. The alarm call is a soft piping whistle or a loud gruff and harsh burst of calls; also gives a wing-rattle display, common just before sunrise or after sunset. Found only in Colombia and Venezuela.

Beautiful, colorful waterbird of marshes from southeast U.S. to South America, especially those with lots of emergent vegetation. Bright bluish-purple body with green back, white undertail, and red bill with yellow tip. Long yellow legs and enormous feet help it walk on lily pads. Immatures are buffy overall with dull olive wings. Usually found alone. Loud vocalizations similar to Common Gallinule.

Unmistakable huge macaw with cobalt blue plumage contrasting with a yellow eyering and bill base. Found at forest borders, in open woodland, and in savanna with palm trees, where mostly seen in pairs but also in small flocks. Feeds on palm fruits on the ground or in trees. Gives a series of loud croaking 'kraaa' notes.

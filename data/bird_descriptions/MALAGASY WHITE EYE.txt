Small, sharp-billed, warbler-like bird. Note yellow patches on the throat and undertail, and bold white spectacles around the eye. Found in all types of forest, and less commonly in scrub, gardens, and plantations. Usually found in hyperactive flocks that can contain dozens of individuals. Often joins mixed flocks of other small birds. Most common call is a high-pitched, rising rattle. Song is a quiet, chatty sequence of “chew” notes. Shows bright yellow patches and white spectacles, unlike any jery. Smaller and more brightly colored than any tetraka.

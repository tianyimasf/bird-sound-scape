Massive pelican with a disheveled appearance. Dirty white overall with a scruffy, upswept crest and black primaries (prominent only in flight). Adult has a bright orange pouch during the breeding season, yellow in the nonbreeding season. Can be confused with Spot-billed Pelican and Great White Pelican, but has a combination of pale iris, clean bill with no spotting, and gray legs. Frequents rivers, extensive wetlands, and estuaries, often in large flocks.

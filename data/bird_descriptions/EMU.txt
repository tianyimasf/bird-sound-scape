Endemic to Australia, this enormous flightless bird has drooping gray shaggy plumage. Only confusion possible with introduced Common Ostrich, but note Emuâ€™s dark head and a shaggy-feathered neck. Hatchlings have distinctive stripes throughout. Juvenile and immature birds are darker than adults with more feathered necks. Prefers open country, where it roams around in loose flocks ranging from a few birds up to hundreds.

A simply patterned, long-tailed rufous thrush. The tail has a dark center and pale reddish sides. Found on or near the ground in humid forest, where it is generally shy and retiring. Often follows ant swarms. Similar to White-tailed Ant-Thrush, but has a reddish rather than black-and-white reddish tail. Also similar to Rufous Flycatcher-Thrush, but has more horizontal posture, and found near the ground rather than at middle levels of the forest. The song is variable and sometimes long: a descending single whistle, two whistles, or a sequence of whistles and trilled notes. The call is a short, trilled “brttt.”

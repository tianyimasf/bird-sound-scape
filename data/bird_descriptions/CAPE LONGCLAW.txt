A large ground-dwelling pipit-like bird. The upperparts are brown and cryptic, but the underparts are striking: the throat is deep orange, hemmed by a broad black necklace, and the belly is yellow. It has white-tipped tail feathers that make the tail distinctive in flight. Pairs occupy high-altitude and coastal grasslands and open pastures. The species is frequently located by its distinctive nasal “wheeeeah” call. Breeding Yellow-breasted Pipit resembles young Orange-throated Longclaw, but the pipit’s outer tail feathers are white, rather than white-tipped.

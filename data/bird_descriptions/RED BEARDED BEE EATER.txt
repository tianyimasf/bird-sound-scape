Unmistakable leaf-green bee-eater of lowland and foothill forests. Namesake “beard” actually goes from the crown all the way down to the belly. Sallies out from a perch at middle and upper levels of forest to snag flying insects. Despite its bright coloration, can often be surprisingly difficult to find; listen for its unique song, a series of descending frog-like croaks.

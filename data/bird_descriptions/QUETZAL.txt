Scarce, large trogon of pine and pine-oak forests in mountains and canyons of northwest Mexico. Usually rather wary, flying long distances when disturbed, but can be found feeding quietly at fruiting trees. Often perches with a hunchbacked posture. Note the rather small head with a grayish bill and mostly white underside to the tail. The "ears" are fine plumes on the sides of the head, rarely visible in the field. Also note the distinctive calls, very different from other trogons.

Fairly common but easily overlooked in dense to fairly open shrub-steppe of Patagonia, where it feeds in bushes and runs well on the ground. Most often seen when singing from atop a bush or fence post; otherwise rather skulking and easily overlooked. The only streak-backed canastero in its southern range. Identified by whitish eyebrow and streaked back; in flight shows bright buffy wing stripe and whitish tail sides. Also compare with Correndera Pipit.

Massive bird of prey, restricted to mature forest and always rare. Enormous talons. Adult is dark gray above, paler below, with obvious dark breast band. Note more obvious black-and-white barring on wings in flight to help separate it from Crested Eagle. Juvenile has whiter head than adult and no breast band; very similar to Crested Eagle but note longer crest with two points (separated in the middle). Feeds on monkeys and sloths. Usually seen perched in the canopy or flying across a road or river, does not soar.

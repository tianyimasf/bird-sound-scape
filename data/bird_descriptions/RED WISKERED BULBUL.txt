Medium-sized songbird, brown above and whitish below with a tall black crest and dark “spur” on the side of the breast. Small red patch on ear and red undertail coverts. White tips on tail feathers. Generally found in pairs or small groups in gardens, orchards, forest edge, and open forests. Pleasant song consists of rich warbled phrases; calls include high-pitched pips, a long buzzy note, and a sharp “pik-pik-a-wew.” A common species in the Asian cagebird trade and escapee populations occasionally become established north of their natural range; also introduced to Florida, California, and Hawaii.

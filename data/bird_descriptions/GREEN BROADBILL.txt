Luminous green bird with an oddly umbrella-like head shape, found in lowland forests. Male has black wingbars and a dark “comma” behind the eye. Female is paler green and plainer overall, with no dark markings. In Borneo, overlaps with Hose’s and Whitehead’s Broadbills, both of which tend to be found at higher elevations. In Green Broadbill, note the lack of black on females in any plumage, the clear bars on the wings instead of spots, and the overall larger size. Gives soft, bouncy hooting notes, often in series.

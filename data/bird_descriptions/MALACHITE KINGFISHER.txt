Small, gem-like wetland kingfisher. Shows geographical variation, with most birds having orange underparts, but birds in some parts of the range have a white belly. Found in almost all habitats with water, including streams, rivers, lakes, rice paddies, and lagoons. Sits motionless for long periods before plunging to the water to snatch prey. Call is a harsh “tshik,” often given in flight. Similar to African Pygmy-Kingfisher, but larger, has less orange on the face, and prefers aquatic habitats.

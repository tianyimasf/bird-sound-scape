A spectacular green turaco with a bushy crest. There are two white marks on the face, though these vary geographically in size, and one subspecies also shows orange on the back of the head. Shows large crimson wing patches in flight. Found in montane forest and woodland. Acts like a typical turaco, bouncing through the trees and flying occasionally with short bursts of wingbeats and long glides. Call is a gruff, accelerating series of “kow” notes. Similar to Prince Ruspoli’s Turaco, but easily separated by its white facial markings.

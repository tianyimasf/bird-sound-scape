Tiny, short-tailed forest sprite with a rusty head, grayish breast, white throat, and long bill. Restricted to eastern Arc montane forest; population on the Uluguru Mountains is darker than others, and with more chestnut on the head. Pairs and small groups skulk in bracken and along other forest edge and undergrowth. Gives a strident and repeated “tzeeew-tzeeew-tzeew”, sometimes in duet with a short rising buzzy “tzier” or other buzzy notes.

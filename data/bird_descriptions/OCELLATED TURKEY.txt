Large, distinctive, spectacular gamebird of tropical forest, brushy fields, and adjacent clearings. Rarely seen away from protected areas, where can be common and tame. Note orange head ‘warts,’ copper-colored wing panel, and iridescent blue-and-gold eyespots (‘ocelli’) on rump and tail tip. Often in groups; feeds on the ground, but roosts in trees. Beware: domestic turkeys are common in the range of Ocellated, but are usually around people.

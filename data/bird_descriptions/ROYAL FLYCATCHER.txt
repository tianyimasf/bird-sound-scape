Uncommon, medium-sized, overall warm brown flycatcher of humid tropical forest in lowlands. Note the hammerhead crestâ€”very rarely fully raised to reveal spectacular, flame-red fan with violet-blue-black tips. Otherwise looks rather flat-headed. Also note the long bill, and pale cinnamon rump and tail. Usually found as singles or pairs in mid-levels of dense forest, where flutters actively after insects. Nest is a straggly mass of dead vegetation up to 3 feet long that hangs from the tip of a branch, often along streambeds. Often detected by single squeaky calls; rarely-heard song variable across range. Occurs from Mexico to Brazil.

This unique and charismatic large flightless bird is the flagship species of New Caledonia. Now sadly limited to a handful of locations with high-quality forest. A bit larger than a domestic chicken, but with longer legs and a more upright posture. Overall powdery-blue colored with a large, expressive crest that can be raised or lowered; legs and bill are bright red. Intricate banded pattern in wings normally not visible except during displays. Very noisy, giving a prolonged nasal hooting and cackling series, often in duet, and most vociferously in the pre-dawn hours.

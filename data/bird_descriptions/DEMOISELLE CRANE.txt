Small gray crane of open expansive habitats. Adult is an elegantly smooth shade of gray with a black neck, fiery eyes, and pure white plumes extending out from behind the eyes. Juvenile is similar but paler overall and with shorter plumes. Dark wingtips, prominent while the bird is in flight, may cause confusion with Gray Heron, but note overall shape and straight-necked flying posture (heron typically tucks neck in). Small size distinguishes this species from other cranes. Inhabits fields, deserts, steppes, and plains with water in general vicinity. May visit drier habitat in winter. Migrates in large, vocal flocks.

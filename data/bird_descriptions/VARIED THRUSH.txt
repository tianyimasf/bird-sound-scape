A beautiful, boldly-patterned thrush. Males are an exquisite combination of blue-gray, orange, and black. Note black breast band, orange eyebrow, and orange markings on the wings. Females show a similarly gorgeous, but duller pattern. Breeds in mature, wet forests in the Pacific Northwest; found in a broader range of wooded habitats with fruiting plants in winter. Can visit feeders. Listen for its song during the breeding season: a slow, haunting series of long, eerie whistles.

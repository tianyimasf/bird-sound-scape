Unique blackish ibis with a bare red face and throat. Long quills form a raggedy mane. Short legs do not project beyond the tail in flight. Breeds in colonies on cliff ledges in semidesert regions; forages in open dry habitats. Critically Endangered with most remaining birds in Morocco; migratory eastern populations in Syria and Turkey all but extinct. Historically bred in central and southern Europe and plans for reintroduction are moving forward.

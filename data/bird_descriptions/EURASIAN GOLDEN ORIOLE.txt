Male unmistakable: golden-yellow with black wings and tail; female and immature greenish yellow overall with dusky wings and variable, fine dark streaking below; note powerful-looking reddish-pink bill in all plumages (dullest in immature). Favors deciduous and mixed woodland and parks, especially with tall leafy trees; can wind up in more open habitats on migration. Shy and difficult to see well, despite bright colors. Tends to remain well hidden in foliage, and flies quickly and easily over long distances. Listen for beautiful, fluid, musical song and rough, corvid-like calls.

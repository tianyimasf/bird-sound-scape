Stocky, large-headed finch with unique crossed bill used to pry seeds out of conifer cones. Males are dull red or orange overall with gray or brown highlights. Females are dull olive-yellow. Immatures are streakier than adults. Look for brownish wings with no wingbars. Different populations feed on different types of conifer seeds; jipping calls vary subtly throughout populations. Nomadic; breeds at any time of year, whenever there is enough food available. Often in small flocks. Rarely visits feeders.

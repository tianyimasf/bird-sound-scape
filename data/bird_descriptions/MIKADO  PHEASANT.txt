A stunning pheasant species endemic to Taiwan, the male a rich slaty blue with white markings and red facial skin, the female rich brown with extensive pale feather edges. Generally retiring, foraging quietly in the undergrowth of montane forests, but occasionally seen in the open, particularly in places where fed. Usually seen singly, in pairs, or in small family units (female with young). In breeding season, males drum with wings and give shrill whistling calls. Male lacks white back and tail of Swinhoe’s Pheasant; female has dark bill, grayish legs, pale markings below, and graduated, pointy tail, unlike female Swinhoe’s.

A very brightly-colored bowerbird of lowland and foothill forests in southern New Guinea. Male unmistakeable. Bright yellow body with black wing edge and tail. Scarlet from the head down to the shoulders and back, resembling a headscarf. Sometimes a yellow line up the center of the chest up to the bill. Female, brown above with yellow underparts and also a distinctive yellow line down the throat. Makes an avenue bower in clearings. Calls, a downward squeal “kwiiiiiiuuu!” and some harsh rasping.

Chunky, short-tailed antbird of mature rainforest understory. Gets its name from its two broad cream wingbars, which give it a banded appearance. Brown above, whitish gray below, with a gray face, and black breast streaking. Oddly shaped, with a chunky, nearly tailless body held horizontally on long legs, like a tiny, compact thrush. Walks deliberately around the forest floor with an odd bobbing gait, moving its head forward and back with each step. Hops up onto logs and low hanging stems as it moves around the forest floor, often shuffling around leaves to expose prey. Its song is a slow series of rising whistles, given at a pace of about one note per second.

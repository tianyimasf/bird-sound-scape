Large woodpecker, very similar to Northern Flicker. Overall pale sandy brown with gray face and brown crown. Spotted below with black oval on chest. Underwing and shafts of flight feathers bright yellow. Males have red mustache stripe; sexes otherwise alike. Combination of face pattern and yellow in wings helps distinguish from both "Red-shafted" and "Yellow-shafted" Northern Flickers. Shows a strong affinity for saguaro cactus but also found in nearby woodland. Gives a piercing "kleer" call similar to Northern Flicker.

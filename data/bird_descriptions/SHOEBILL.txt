Utterly unique bird that makes up its own family. The plumage is uniformly gray in adults and brownish in immatures. Structure is stork-like overall, but with a thick neck and massive hooked bill. In flight, which is sometimes quite high, the long legs trail. Found in deep marshes, especially papyrus swamp. Usually alone or in pairs.

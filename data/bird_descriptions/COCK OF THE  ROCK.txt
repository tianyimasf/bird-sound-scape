A large, chunky cotinga, always preceded by its reputation. Exquisite adult male is impossible to mistake for anything else; young males and females are brown and best identified by size, odd shape and pale eyes. Most readily found in lowland rainforest near rock formations that provide nest sites. Often seen flying across small rivers or roads, but generally difficult to observe away from display areas. Feeds on fruit. Calls, occasionally given in alarm and while foraging, are querulous and fowl-like.

A medium-sized mostly buff-brown”‘ringneck” dove with a rosy-mauve neck and breast, dusky gray head, and a uniquely yellow eye surrounded by red bare skin. In flight it has visible white in the outer tail. Frequents savanna and woodland, particularly alongside humans and in well-wooded areas. Produces a distinctive “Look AT me” song, as well as a variety of crooning throaty “craaaooow” calls. All similar ringneck-doves lack the yellow eye surrounded by red bare skin.

Very pretty small finch-like bird with red bill, red eyes, and distinctly barred flanks. Sexes are similar, but males have brighter greens and yellows than females. Juveniles are brown above, pale with some yellow below, but have the red bill. Very rare and local. Known to occur in flocks in dry areas with open woodland, scrub, and agriculture.

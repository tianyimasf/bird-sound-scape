Small migratory songbird of mature forest with distinctive orange breast and dull brown upperparts. Sticks to undergrowth in both montane breeding grounds and lowland wintering grounds, though presence in the former may be given away by its loud song: a trill following a single introductory note. Forages on the ground and prefers to stick to shady areas. Occasionally found in parks and gardens on migration.

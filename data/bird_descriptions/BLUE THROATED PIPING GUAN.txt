Large, lanky, black and white bird of lowland rainforest. Note the bare, white face and white wing patches, which really stand out in flight. Crown and nape are also mostly white, but also streaked with buff. It has a fleshy throat patch that is typically blue, but it may be gray or black on some birds. Mostly arboreal, but sometimes descends to the ground to feed or drink. Song, often given at dawn or dusk, is a rising series of clear whistles. Occasionally rattles its wings loudly in flight.

Similar to significantly smaller Rose-ringed Parakeet; note Alexandrine’s dark red shoulder patches and larger bill. Raucous and loud; gives piercing screeches and screams. Found in both dry and wet forest, typically in lowlands but occasionally in foothills. Native to South and Southeast Asia, introduced to parts of Europe and Hong Kong.

While common in bamboo forest, this loud and colorful partridge can be found in a range of other shrubby and semiopen habitats. Not particularly shy; singing males can be located by their far-carrying song, a rising series of piercing single and triple notes. The combination of a gray-blue brow and chest, orange cheeks and breast band, and large black spots on brownish yellow flanks make this species unmistakable in its range.

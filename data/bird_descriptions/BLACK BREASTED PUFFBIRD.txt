Rather large puffbird found from central Panama to extreme northwest Ecuador. Striking black-and-white pattern; especially note broad black breast band and isolated white cheek patch. Typically found singly or in pairs; usually perched in the canopy or subcanopy of lowland forest and edge below 1,000 m. Pied Puffbird is smaller with a white eyebrow. White-necked Puffbird is larger with a white forehead and more extensive white on the neck and forehead (lacking a black mustache).

Immense and stately ground-dwelling bird of expansive grasslands; also found more infrequently in other open grassy habitats such as semi-desert and lightly worked fields. Brown-winged and pale-necked, with a dark cap; male has whiter neck than female. Often found in small flocks when not breeding. Unfortunately, critically endangered and declining throughout range.

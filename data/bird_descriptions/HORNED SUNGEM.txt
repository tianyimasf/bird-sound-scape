Stunning hummingbird with a short straight bill. Males have a dark blue crown with red, blue, and gold tufted “horns” on the side. Otherwise largely metallic green above and white below with a black throat. Females have a green cap and lack the horns. Found in riverine belts and open savanna grasslands; may venture into adjacent human-modified habitats.

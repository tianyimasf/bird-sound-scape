Heavy-billed small toucan of humid tropical forest. Forages in the canopy of mature rainforest, often in small groups, and sometimes with other species of aracaris. More diffuse facial pattern than other aracaris, with grayish crown covered with soft curls. Belly has a single red band. Not as vocal as other aracaris, but may be heard giving soft grunts and occasionally loud yelps, sounding rather raptor-like.

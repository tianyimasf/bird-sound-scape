A medium-sized bird of montane forest canopy. Male has a yellow belly, black upperparts and bib, and orange flight feathers. Note the 2 outlandishly long, antennalike feathers protruding from the side of the head. Female has gray-brown upperparts and whitish underparts with dark scaling. Male is unmistakable. Female is somewhat similar to female lophorinas and parotias, but is distinctly smaller and grayer with buffy under the base of the tail. Voice, a weird, insectlike, continuous rattle sounding rather like radio static. Sometimes given while waving its long head feathers about in its courtship display and bouncing up and down.

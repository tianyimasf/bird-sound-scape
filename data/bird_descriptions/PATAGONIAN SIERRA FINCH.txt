Attractive small “finch” that is actually a tanager; found in humid forest and wooded habitats in southern Chile and adjacent Argentina. Despite the name, not really a bird of dry Patagonian habitats. Often in groups, especially in winter, and feeds from the ground to high in trees. Male has a gray hood and distinctive golden back. Female and immature are similar to Gray-hooded Sierra-Finch, but are more extensively yellow below and the whisker marks are weaker.

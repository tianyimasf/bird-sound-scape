Common and conspicuous, this flashy, long-tailed crow relative is unmistakable, and its loud chattering calls are a familiar sound in many areas. Found in open and semiopen areas from farmland and open woodland to towns and gardens, singly or more often in pairs or groups. Bulky stick nest often conspicuous in tall tree or hedgerow. Boldly pied plumage is distinctive, with white belly, white back, and white wing patches. Wings show blue-green gloss in good light.

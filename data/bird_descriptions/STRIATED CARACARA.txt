Fairly common locally on the Falklands and on remote and largely inaccessible islands south and west of Tierra del Fuego. Habits much like other caracaras; walks with agility to scavenge for food, and sails, soars, and tumbles easily on updrafts. Plumage dark overall, but with whitish wing panels visible in flight. Adult has fine silvery streaking (striations) on neck and breast, a yellow face, and a pale bill; immature is browner with duller streaking and a dark bill.

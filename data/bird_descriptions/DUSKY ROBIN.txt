Medium-sized, rather long-tailed Australian robin, both sexes plain brown overall. Darker than similar species and lacking any pale wing panels. Often perches on a rock or stump, from which it pounces on prey on the ground. Endemic to Tasmania, where inhabits open forests, gardens, and coastal heathland.

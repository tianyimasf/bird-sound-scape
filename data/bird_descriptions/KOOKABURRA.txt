Common, very large kingfisher with a dark eye and brown cheek patch. In Queensland take care to identify from Blue-winged Kookaburra, which has a pale eye and a pale streaked head. Typical calls include an immediately recognizable and distinctive laugh, which gives the species its common name. Abundant in parks, towns, forests, and campgrounds.

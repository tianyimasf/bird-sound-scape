Large raptor. Uniform black with silvery patches on undersides of wingtips. In flight, broad, rounded wings with distinct "fingers" are held flat like a board. Notice very short tail and small black head. Soars in flocks, often with other vultures and hawks. Flight style is distinctive; bat-like, strong snappy wingbeats followed by short glides. Look for them along highways eating roadkill, or picking through dumpsters.

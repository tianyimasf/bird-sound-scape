Breeds exclusively in mixed juniper-oak woodland in central Texas. Seldom seen in migration. Male has jet-black crown, throat, and back; bright yellow face with a black line through the eye. Two white wingbars; white underparts with black streaks down the sides. Female and immatures duller with pale throat, olive-green back and crown; similar to Black-throated Green Warbler, but note more distinct dark line through eye and lack of yellow vent. Winters in mountainous pine-oak forest in Mexico and Central America. Variable song includes several trills and buzzes at different pitches.

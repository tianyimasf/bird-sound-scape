A blood-red Hawaiian honeycreeper found on all of the larger islands. Smaller and darker red than the Iiwi, with a shorter black bill and white under the tail. Juveniles are brown instead of red. Sometimes abundant in native forest at high elevations and also occurs at lower elevations in some areas where it usually stays high in the forest canopy. Large numbers may congregate in a flowering tree. Sometimes holds the tail cocked up. Often flies in flocks, sometimes high above the forest. Song consists of 2–3 soft notes followed by a reedy trill: “dee-der-di-di-di-di.”

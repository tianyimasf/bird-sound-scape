Large, beautiful swallow with a long, forked tail. Note the rufous cap, cinnamon rump, and pale buffy underparts with fine streaking. Usually found in grassland and wetland, though can be seen in other habitats, especially when migrating. Often in flocks, sometimes mixed with other swallow species. Similar to Lesser Striped Swallow, but larger, with buffy underparts with finer streaks, and with less orange on the face.

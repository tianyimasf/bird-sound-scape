A spectacular red parrot with forest-green wings, thighs, and tail tip. Tail is short and rounded. Most show a yellow patch on the back, but this is absent in the Halmahera form. Adults have a mainly red bill, brownish in immatures. Pairs inhabit forest and edge in lowlands and foothills, but are most abundant in hills. Distinguished from Moluccan King-Parrot by short, rounded tail and red back, and from Violet-necked Lory by lack of extensive dark areas on body. Gives a high-pitched “weee-ooo,” harsh “kraa” notes, and screeches.

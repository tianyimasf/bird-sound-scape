Small white, gray, and black bird with a white rump and black tail. Adult has a thin black outline around pale face, lending a sort of "Barn Owl" look, as well as a second thin black breast band. Juvenile similar in pattern but dirtier gray. Inhabits open grassy habitats of far northern and eastern Australia, seen typically in pairs or small groups feeding on the ground.

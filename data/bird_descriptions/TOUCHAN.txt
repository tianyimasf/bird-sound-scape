Large and impressive toucan with a huge orange bill with a black tip and base. The body is mostly black with a white throat, and rump, and a red vent. Dark eyes are surrounded by orange and blue skin. Found in savanna and open woodland, avoiding humid forests. Makes a raucous far carrying croaking “wreh” call, and flies with noisy wingbeats.

A small gray hornbill with a casque-less pale bill, a black undertail with white tips, and a pale eyebrow. Sexes are alike, except that the females have black on the base of the bill. In flight, the white tips to the outer edges of the wings contrast strongly with the otherwise very dark undersides of the wings. It is found in evergreen forests and plantations. The call is a distinctive series of yelping sounds that rise to a crescendo, sounding like manic laughter.

A chunky, large-headed bird with a lilac breast, rusty cheeks, and spring-green crown. Singles and pairs sit on prominent perches in open woodland and lightly-treed grasslands. It has an amazing display flight which includes side-to-side rolling, which gives rollers their name. Mostly quiet, but sometimes calls a loud guttural “gwhaaak, gwhaaak”. European Roller is chunkier, has a blue breast and face, and has a shorter, square-tipped tail.

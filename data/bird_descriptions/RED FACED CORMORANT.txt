Dark glossy-green cormorant with a bluish neck, red face, and yellowish bill. White patches on sides of rump. Juveniles are duller than adults, especially on the face, but usually show some pale pinkish at the base of the bill. Found on rocky coastlines; breeds in colonies on precarious cliff faces. Range extends from the Kenai Peninsula in Alaska, out the Aleutian and Pribilof Islands to the Kamchatcka Peninsula, and down the Kuril Islands to Hokkaido. Most similar to Pelagic Cormorant but note thicker neck, brighter face, and thicker, paler bill. Feeds on fish.

Medium-sized dove with spotted wings, a distinctive striped neck patch and a bold white tip to the rounded tail. Found in wooded and semiopen habitats, especially farmland and heath with hedges and scattered trees. Usually rather shy; seen mainly in flight, but at times perched on utility wires. Feeds on ground, where it may associate with other pigeons. Appreciably smaller and slimmer than much commoner and overall paler Eurasian Collared-Dove. Extremely similar in plumage to Oriental Turtle-Dove, but has less extensive dark centers to the wing feathers and averages pinker on the breast.

Large, long-tailed bird with rich blue plumage, black head, coral-red bill and feet, and yellow eye. Inhabits lower foothills to lower montane forests and edges (to 1200 m), occasionally venturing into forested parks. Forages in small flocks gliding from tree to tree. Long tail especially apparent in flight. Noisy; gives loud, sharp “kack” calls (much like Eurasian Magpie) and rasping notes.

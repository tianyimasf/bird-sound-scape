A fairly large, common raptor of forest and more open wooded areas from the lowlands to the lower mountains. Dark brown with white speckles on the crown and upperparts, rufous-brown below with large white spots. Note the gray cheek and yellow eye. Differs from other raptors in its range by its bare yellow skin between the bill and eye, and in flight by its dark terminal band to the wings and tail. Often gives a whistled “weeeeeuuuu weu weu” in flight, or sometimes just a single note.

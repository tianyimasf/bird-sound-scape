Large, chunky, all-gray cuckooshrike. There is a pale ring around the dark eye, giving the face a gentle appearance. Males are darker gray than females. Found in forest; away from South Africa, exclusively in montane forest. Quiet and unobtrusive bird that is easily missed as it moves slowly through the forest midstory. Call is a quiet, high-pitched, descending “seeeeuup.” Similar to White-breasted Cuckooshrike, but has much darker underparts and is found in forest rather than woodland.

Heavily built, flat-headed dark blue bird with a short bright red bill. In flight has a characteristic white circle, or ‘dollar’, on each underwing. Juvenile lacks red bill. May resemble mynas in flight, but note longer wings, larger head, and more powerful, less frantic flight. Nests in cavities; typically tree hollows. Frequently perches on power-lines or in the tops of tall dead trees.

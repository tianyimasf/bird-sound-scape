Sturdy dark gray bird with stout black bill, plain in plumage but full of character. Usually in family groups that forage low and on the ground, following each other around, gliding between trees and chattering to each other constantly with scratchy, squeaky calls. Habituated to people in some camping and picnic areas. Inhabits eastern Australia; more common in drier inland areas but sometimes found in coastal areas (e.g., parts of Brisbane).

An amazing and distinctive red-throated and green-backed pheasant with different-looking sexes: male is blue-black below with a white crest, and female has russet underparts and crest. Africa’s only pheasant, unlikely to be confused with other birds. Very rare, skittish, and seldom seen, restricted to the central Congo Basin of Democratic Republic of Congo, which is difficult to access. Pairs duet, often at night, with a “goway-gowaa” and also a guttural “kuw-kuw” contact call.

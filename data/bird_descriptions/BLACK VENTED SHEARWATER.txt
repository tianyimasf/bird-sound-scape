Small brown-and-white shearwater with messy appearance. Especially note smudgy face and neck. Found in warmer ocean waters off the west coast of North America, often close to land. Found singly or in small flocks, sometimes with other shearwaters. Most similar to Manx Shearwater but ranges do not usually overlap; also look for smudgier head, longer bill, and darker undertail coverts on Black-vented. Also compare with much larger Pink-footed Shearwater.

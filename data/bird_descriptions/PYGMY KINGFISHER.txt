Small, almost fluorescent orange forest kingfisher. Endemic to Madagascar, where it is most common in eastern and northern rainforest, though it also occurs locally in western deciduous forest. Sits motionless for long periods before darting after prey, most often frogs. Call is a harsh “tshik,” often given in flight. Separated from Malagasy Kingfisher by orange upperparts and bill. Prefers forest, whereas Malagasy Kingfisher is found in wetlands.

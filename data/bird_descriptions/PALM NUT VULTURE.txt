Small, odd, distinctive vulture. Adults are boldly patterned black-and-white, with red bare facial skin. Juveniles are brown. Immature birds show a mixture of juvenile and adult traits. Distinctive shape in flight: broad, paddle-shaped wings and a short, wide tail. Found in a variety of habitats, including forest, woodland, and savanna--usually in the vicinity of palms. Somewhat similar to African Fish-Eagle, but easily separated by red facial skin and different pattern of black and white. Juveniles are similar to Hooded Vulture, but are smaller, with a thicker bill.

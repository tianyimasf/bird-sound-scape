A relatively pale kingbird, medium-gray above and white below with a darker face mask. Primarily a Caribbean species with limited range in U.S.; found around the edge of dense woodland, especially near the coast. Also seen in more suburban areas. Often perches conspicuously on a snag, treetop, or powerline. Feeds on insects. Listen for its high-pitched twittering calls. Compare with Eastern and Loggerhead Kingbirds; Gray Kingbird has lighter gray upperparts, a thicker bill, and lacks white tail tips.

Conspicuous, social, and noisy inhabitant of high mountains. Feeds mostly on insects in summer and berries, seeds, and food waste in winter, scavenging around ski resorts, towns, and monasteries, where it can be very tame. Told from juvenile Red-billed Chough by its shorter, bright yellow bill and shorter wing fingers. Wings do not extend to the tail tip when perched. Gives a strange, squeaky trill very unlike calls of crows and ravens, as well as a high-pitched descending squeak.

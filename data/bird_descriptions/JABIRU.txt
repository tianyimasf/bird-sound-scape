Huge, massive-billed, and unmistakable stork of tropical lowlands. Found in marshes and flooded fields, but nests high in large trees. Sometimes seen feeding in wetlands in loose association with other wading birds, which are all much smaller. Flies strongly and often high overhead, sometimes even soaring like a vulture. Plumage is wholly white (no black in wings in flight) but the naked head and neck are black, with a broad red band at base of the neck.

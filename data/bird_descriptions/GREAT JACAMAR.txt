The largest jacamar is glistening emerald-green above and orange below with a thick black bill. Sexes generally similar; males have entirely green throat and inconspicuous white collar, females have orange throat. Size and bill shape could recall a motmot more than a jacamar, but no motmot combines green head and orange belly. Singles or pairs are typically uncommon to rare in lowland forests, up to around 600 m. They typically perch in the middle to upper levels, and can be quite vocal. Listen for the long descending whistle with a noticeable break in pitch near the beginning, as well as various strange noises that sound like a very angry cat.

Large black bird found inside forest, usually at middle levels. Reminiscent of a crow with a funky hairdo; unlike any other species in its range. Maleâ€™s bare red throat sac is usually visible, even when not inflated. Female lacks the throat sac and the puffy umbrella-like crest, but she is still distinctively large and all-black. Rare and local.

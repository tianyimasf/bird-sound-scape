Uncommon, medium-sized pheasant. Male is almost unbelievable-looking; an immense fan of a snow-white tail sticks out of a rotund, coal-black body. All-rufous-brown female is more normal-looking; her tail is shorter and narrower. Both sexes have sky-blue facial skin, but the maleâ€™s extends into wattles, which he erects during display. Found in hilly areas in foothill and montane forest; sometimes nomadic, seeking out fruiting trees.

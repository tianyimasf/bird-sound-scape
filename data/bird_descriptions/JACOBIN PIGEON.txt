Rather large, spectacular hummingbird of humid tropical lowlands that favors forest edges, adjacent clearings with scattered trees and flowering bushes, and gardens. Feeds at all levels, often in the canopy, hovering with its tail cocked and occasionally opening it to show extensive white. Male has deep blue hood, green upperparts with white collar (often hard to see), white underparts, and mostly white tail. Some females look similar to males while others look very different, with dark spotting below and a mostly green tail with white tips.

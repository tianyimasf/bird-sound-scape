A brilliant and brash resident of thornscrub, cactus forests and other arid landscapes. Rather large-headed, often sporting a short shaggy crest, with a blue teardrop of bare skin around each eye, thus differing from most other orioles. Also note the long white slash on each wing. The Baltimore Oriole is passingly similar, but it is smaller, less bulky, and has less black on the chest than Venezuelan Troupial. Vocalizations are mostly loud and flutelike. They include an upward inflected “chu-wee,” a down slurred “shee-oo,” a quick series “thank-you, thank-you, thank-you, chu-eee, che-ee, chu-ee,” and “Chu-oo-eee-o.”

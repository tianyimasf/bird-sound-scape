Small bowerbird restricted to higher-elevation rainforest in Northern Queensland. Male has stunning bright yellow underparts, yellowish-brown face, and dull yellowish back. Female olive brown above, gray below. Breeding male builds a large tower of sticks and decorates it with flowers and lichen, often reusing the same bower for many nesting seasons. Maleâ€™s song includes a wide repertoire of notes and sounds, many of which sound as though they were made by a machine.

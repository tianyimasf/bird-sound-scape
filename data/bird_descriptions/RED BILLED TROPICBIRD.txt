Spectacular seabird, very rarely seen from land but found locally around rocky islands near shore. Usually seen as single birds sitting on the sea or as pairs chasing and screeching around cliffs, often high overhead. Feeds by vertical plunge dives, which produce a plume of water like a mini whale blow. Adult has stout red bill and long white tail streamers. Immature has yellow bill and short, black-tipped tail.

A small Hawaiian honeycreeper of high elevation native forests on Kauai. Males are bright yellow and females are yellowish green. Smaller than the Kauai Amakihi with a straighter bill and without the faint black line between the bill and the eye. Moves quickly and incessantly in the understory and forest canopy in search of nectar, insects, and fruit. Fairly common in more remote areas of the eastern Alakai Plateau; uncommon to rare in the western Alakai and Kokee State Park. Song is a trill consisting of paired notes “weesee-weesee-weesee.” Call is a soft upslurred “su-weet.”

Spectacular motmot of tropical lowlands, mainly in drier areas. Favors dry forest and edge, semiopen areas with scattered trees, gardens. One of the more conspicuous motmots, especially in spring, when often perches on roadside wires and on open branches. Plumage distinctive, with turquoise brow, turquoise-blue wings and tail with big rackets. Nests colonially at cenotes (sacred wells) in some Maya ruins of the Yucatan Peninsula, Mexico; motmot nests are burrows dug in banks, like a kingfisher.

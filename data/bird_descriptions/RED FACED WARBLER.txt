Small pretty warbler. Green on the upperparts, red on the face and throat, and white on the belly. Found in montane forest, mostly in the mid-story and canopy. Like other woodland-warblers, active and always on the move. The distinctive song consists of higher and lower “spit” notes that are quickly alternated in a sort of very loose trill. Similar to Brown Woodland-Warbler, but paler on the belly, with more red on the face and throat.

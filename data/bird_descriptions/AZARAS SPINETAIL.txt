Small, long-tailed bird that skulks in thickets and tangles. Mostly gray with rufous cap, wings, and tail. Sexes alike. More often heard than seen; listen for distinctive “whip-WEEP!” song repeatedly coming from dense scrubby areas. Found at fairly high elevations in the Andes, mostly from 1,500–3,000 m, higher than most other species of Synallaxis spinetails.

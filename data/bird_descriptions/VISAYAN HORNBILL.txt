A fairly large bird of lowland and foothill forest on Panay and Negros islands. Small for a hornbill. Bill fairly short with black bands. Has black wings, a pale buffy tail with black tip, and bare skin around the eye and chin with a blue tinge. Male has pale underparts and head with a black cheek, while female is entirely black. Male is unmistakable in range. Female is similar to female Writhe-billed Hornbill, but smaller, and lacks the red bill. Voice is a short, medium-pitched honk, reminiscent of a squeaky toy.

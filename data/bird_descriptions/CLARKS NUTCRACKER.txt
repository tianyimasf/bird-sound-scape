This relative of jays and crows is pale gray with a whitish face and black wings. Sexes are similar; juveniles are browner than adults. Found almost exclusively in coniferous forests at high elevations; feeds on pine cone seeds and stashes thousands of them in various places to eat later in the winter. Often found in flocks. Sometimes visits feeders. Similar in color to Canada Jay, but especially note bill shape: long, slender, and sharply pointed.

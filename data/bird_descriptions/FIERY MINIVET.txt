Brightly-colored and social, this long-tailed passerine can often be found perched up overlooking the canopy or flying overhead. Very similar to Scarlet, Long-tailed, and Short-billed minivets. Similar-looking Scarlet Minivet has two disjunct bright patches on the wings, whereas these patches are connected in Fiery. Other minivets are larger overall and brighter red (versus more orange) in adult male plumage. Female Fiery’s reddish-orange rump is unique and if seen separates her from other female black-and-red minivets. Inhabits lowland and foothill forests and forest edge. Gives a high, thin, rising “swee.”

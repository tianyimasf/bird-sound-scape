An unobtrusive bird with an oversized head and bill. Look for tiger-striped patternâ€”warm cinnamon-brown overall with uneven black barring. Also note slightly darker cap and staring pale eye. Uncommon; found around forest edge and secondary woodland in the lowlands from Panama to western Ecuador. Perches still for long periods of time, often on an exposed perch. Frequently detected by distinctive wolf-whistling calls.

This behemoth is unmistakable solely due to its massive size, much larger than any other raptor or vulture. Adults are black with a white stripe on the underwing and an orange head. Wingtips are splayed into conspicuous fingertips. Young birds are duller with a gray head and only slightly paler stripe on the underwing. Found in very small numbers in coastal hills and mountains of California and around the Grand Canyon. Usually seen soaring singly or in pairs. Critically endangered; only recently has this species started breeding successfully again in the wild.

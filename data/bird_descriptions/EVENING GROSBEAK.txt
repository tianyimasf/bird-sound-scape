Large finch, nearly twice the size of a goldfinch. Stocky with strong, thick, pale bill and short, notched tail. Males are stunning with dark head fading to bright yellow underparts, and mostly black wings with bright white secondaries. Females are overall gray with some white on the wing. Flocks often come to feeders for sunflower seeds. Found in forested regions especially at higher elevations. Populations declining dramatically.

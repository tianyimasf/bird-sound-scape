Tiny rainforest-dwelling parrot. Male has red cheeks. Primarily green with varying levels of red and blue on the face depending on the subspecies. Typically flies quickly overhead or feeds inconspicuously in rainforest canopies. From Little Lorikeet by pale underwings (Little Lorikeet has dark wings), and yellow line near the folded wing (lacking on Little Lorikeet). Its call, usually heard in flight, is a distinctive metallic ‘tzeet-tzeet’. Excavates hollows in softwood rainforest trees.

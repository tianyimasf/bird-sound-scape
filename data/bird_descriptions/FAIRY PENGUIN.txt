Tiny blue-gray penguin with pale eye. Nests on the southern coastline of Australia and across New Zealand, where it breeds in burrows in dunes or rocks, often in human-made breakwaters. Usually seen swimming on the surface out to sea, or when arriving ashore in the evening. Distinguished by small size and pale plumage, lacking any black.

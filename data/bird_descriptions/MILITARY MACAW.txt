Spectacular, huge, and long-tailed parrot, wiped out from most areas by capture for the pet trade. Found very locally in forested foothills, canyons, and adjacent semiopen areas with big trees. Usually in pairs or loose groups made up of pairs. Unmistakable, bright green overall with mostly blue wings from above and golden yellow below, and red-and-blue tail. Calls are deep, throaty roars that carry long distances.

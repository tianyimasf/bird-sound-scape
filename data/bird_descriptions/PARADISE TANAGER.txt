Small, stunningly colorful tanager of Amazonian lowlands. Bright green head contrasts with red, blue, and black body. Sexes alike. Often quite common within its range. Found in the canopy of humid forest, often in mixed-species flocks. Likes to stay high in the canopy, but occasionally moves lower into the midstory, moving quickly between perches as it forages.

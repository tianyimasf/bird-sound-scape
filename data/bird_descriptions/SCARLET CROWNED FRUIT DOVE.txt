A colorful dove that often sits motionless in the canopy. Males are distinctive, with a bright silver face and chest, a purple forehead, and a bright yellow tip to the tail. Female similar but more subtly colored. Female resembles female Many-colored Fruit-Dove, but has a bolder crimson forehead and a less contrasting green neck. Call is usually two low cooing notes followed by an accelerating, messy cacophony of similar notes.

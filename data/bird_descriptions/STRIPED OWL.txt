Fairly large, pale, eared owl with honey-colored eyes. Favors savannas and other open areas with scattered trees and bushes, such as cane fields and open plantations. Roosts in dense foliage or on the ground, but often hunts from roadside perches such as utility wires. Note the prominent ear tufts (rarely held flattened), whitish face rimmed with black, and whitish underparts with neat dark streaking. Compare with Short-eared Owl.

Breeding males are unmistakable: bright cerulean above with bold white wingbars, white belly, and orange breast. Females are plain buffy brown with paler wingbars and slightly brighter orangey breast. Breeds on shrubby hillsides and other semiopen habitats in western North America. Males often sing from a high exposed perch. Winters mainly in Mexico, where it frequently gathers in flocks in weedy fields. Females can be very difficult to distinguish from Indigo Bunting, although their range doesn't overlap much. Lazuli never shows streaks below like female Indigo Bunting often does; also note bolder wingbars, brighter breast, and less contrasting pale throat.

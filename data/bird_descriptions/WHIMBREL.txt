Large, brown shorebird with long, decurved bill. Note bold head stripes. Occurs on mudflats, beaches, and coastal marshes. Often in flocks, sometimes mixed with other large shorebirds like Willet or godwits. Extensive global range, breeding on the Arctic tundra and wintering on coastlines as far south as Tierra del Fuego. Generally uncommon to rare inland. Most similar to Bristle-thighed Curlew, which overlaps locally in Alaska and the South Pacific. Whimbrel is colder brown and lacks the bright buffy rump of Bristle-thighed. Also compare with shorter-billed Little Curlew in Asia, and larger curlews like Long-billed, Eurasian, and Far Eastern. Listen for call, a series of short, shrill whistles.

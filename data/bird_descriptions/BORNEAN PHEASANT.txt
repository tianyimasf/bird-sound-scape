With his iridescent pale blue crest, bright orange facial skin patch, and luminous blue spots along his wings and broad fan-shaped tail, the eccentric-looking male is unmistakable if seen well. Female is less eye-catching: warm brown all over with smaller, darker spots. Inhabits primary lowland and hill forest, favoring areas with ridges. Typically quiet; occasionally gives loud, harsh calls.

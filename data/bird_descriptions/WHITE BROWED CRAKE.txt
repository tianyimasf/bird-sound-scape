A delicate-looking inhabitant of densely vegetated wetlands, where it scrambles over floating plants and between the stems of standing ones. Brown above and pale gray below, with a small black mask around the eye bound in by two bold white stripes. Prefers to run away instead of fly; flight is weak, with dangling legs. Call is a loud, raspy “kii-kah,” often repeated.

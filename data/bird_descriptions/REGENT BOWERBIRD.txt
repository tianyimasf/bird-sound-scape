Small forest bowerbird. Males and females differ greatly. Males are black with stunning bright gold on the head and wings. Females are light brown with scalloping on the breast and back; they are much smaller and more lightly build than big, plump Satin Bowerbirds. Males have a bright yellow bill, while femaleâ€™s is black-gray. Usually found in rainforest. The male builds a small open bower out of twigs and decorates it with small objects in order to attract a mate. This species is not very vocal and is usually only heard calling near a bower.

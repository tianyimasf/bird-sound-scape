Blue and yellow rosella with a bright red head/chest and white cheeks. May hybridize with Pale-headed Rosella in areas where the distribution overlaps in far north New South Wales and southeastern Queensland (hybrids typically show some red on the head, but with more blue on the chest; they look a bit washed out). Occurs in open forests and woodlands and may also be found in parks and gardens. Normal range is south eastern Australia and Tasmania. Introduced populations occur in New Zealand.

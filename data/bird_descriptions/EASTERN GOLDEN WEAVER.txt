Breeding male is bright yellow, female is duller yellow, and non-breeding plumages are duller still. Has a reddish eye in all plumages. Breeds in and around reedbeds, but ranges widely into surrounding savanna and woodland. Vocalizations are typical of weavers: “chet” notes and a sizzling, “radio static” song. Other golden-weavers are similar, but never show reddish eyes.

Small stout heron; favors freshwater marshes, lakes, and ponds with reeds and other surrounding vegetation. Tends to hunt rather sluggishly, hunched quietly at the edge of the water. At rest, appears buffy brown overall, but in flight transforms to mostly white when white wings and tail are revealed. Breeding adult has a rich buffy neck; nonbreeding and immature have a streaked neck.

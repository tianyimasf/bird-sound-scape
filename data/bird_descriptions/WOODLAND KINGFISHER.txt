A medium-sized, electric-blue-backed kingfisher with a distinctive bicolored bill: red above and black below. Pairs and singles mostly hunt insects in taller dry woodland, riverine forest, and forest edges. Its loud and characteristic call is a high-pitched “tuuui”, followed by a pause and then a trilling, down-slurred “trrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr”. Sometimes it advertises by sitting upright, extending its wings to show a bold wing pattern, and calling. Almost all of Africa’s other similar kingfishers have a uniformly red-orange (not bicolored) bill, except the Blue-breasted Kingfisher, which differs by being larger, having a complete pale-blue breast band, and preferring denser lowland rainforest.

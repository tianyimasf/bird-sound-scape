Small, compact diving duck with large head and small gray bill. Breeding males are black and white with large white patch on back of head. Females and immature males are gray-brown with white patch on cheek. Much smaller than Common Goldeneye with which it often associates. Found in bays, estuaries, reservoirs, and lakes in winter. Travels to boreal forest and nests in cavities in summer.

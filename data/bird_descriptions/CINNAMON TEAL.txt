Small duck with chalky-blue patches on the upperwing (visible in flight). Breeding males unmistakable with rich reddish-brown color overall. Females are buffy-brownish overall and intricately patterned. Look for rather plain face and longer, more spatulate-shaped bill than Blue-winged Teal. Widespread and fairly common throughout western North America and South America, as far south as Tierra del Fuego. Usually found in shallow wetlands or marshes, where it can occur in pairs or flocks, sometimes mixed with other species of ducks.

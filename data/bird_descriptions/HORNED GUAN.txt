Large, long-tailed game bird restricted to undisturbed humid evergreen forest on a few high mountains in Guatemala and adjacent southern Chiapas, Mexico; very rare and local. Mainly found singly in forest canopy, where can be easily overlooked. Unmistakable: black and white overall with red horn on top of head and piercing whitish eyes.

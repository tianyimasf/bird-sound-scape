A small, grayish brown dove with dark bars on the breast and back, and bare blue skin around the eye. The call is a rapid series of short “coos,” higher pitched and faster than Spotted Dove. Native to Southeast Asia, but introduced to many islands, including the Hawaiian Islands, French Polynesia, Mauritius, and the Seychelles. It is generally quite abundant throughout both its native and non-native range, especially in urban and suburban areas; typically not found in dense forests.

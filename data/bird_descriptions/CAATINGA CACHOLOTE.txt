Unmistakable. Large ovenbird with uniform cinnamon plumage, bushy crest, and yellow eyes. Occurs in dry forests (caatinga) and scrub, often near human habitations. Mostly forages on the ground. Builds a large thorny stick nest. Sings in a duet: the male emits an accelerating series which finishes in a rattle, and the female gives continuous buzzy “zjeep” notes.

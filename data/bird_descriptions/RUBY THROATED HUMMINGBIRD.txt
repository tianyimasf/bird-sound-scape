Small hummingbird found in a variety of woodland and brushy habitats. Male distinctive with ruby-red throat and black chin. Female has whitish underparts with almost no buffy tones (perhaps a very light wash on flanks). Readily comes to sugar water feeders and flower gardens. Default summer hummingbird over most of eastern U.S. and Canada. Winters south to Panama. Very difficult to distinguish from Black-chinned Hummingbird, especially females and young males; thankfully limited range overlap. Ruby-throated averages somewhat brighter green above, shorter- and straighter-billed, and has slightly narrower outer wing feathers, but these differences are all extremely subtle.

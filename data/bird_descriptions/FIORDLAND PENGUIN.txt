Tall penguin endemic to New Zealand, with distinct broad yellow eyebrow that spreads out and sags down the neck. The orange bill has no bare skin at the base. Breeds and molts in dense coastal forest, thick shrubs, and caves along the southwestern coast of the South Island and Stewart Island. Calls vary from emphatic trumpeting to a low-pitched growl or hiss. Look for white stripes on cheek which can be splayed out when threatened. Cheek stripes and lack of bare skin at base of bill help distinguish this species from Snares and Erect-crested Penguins.

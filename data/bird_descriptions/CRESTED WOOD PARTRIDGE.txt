This charming ball of a bird can be difficult to see as it forages quietly on the forest floor within its preferred wet forest habitat. Male has a glossy black body and bristly reddish pompom crest. Female is moss-green with warm cinnamon-brown wings. Both sexes have a bright red ring around the eye. Listen for its song, a series of piercing tremulous whistles.

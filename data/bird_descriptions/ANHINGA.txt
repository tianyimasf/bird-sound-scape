Long-necked “snake bird” found in wooded swamps, marshes, and ponds. Males are black with white on wing; females similar but with brownish neck and head. Dives underwater and spears fish with dagger-like bill. Often swims with only head and neck out of water. Like cormorants, perches out in the open to spread wings and dry feathers. Similar shape to cormorants but even longer-tailed with a more sharply pointed bill. Occasionally soars.

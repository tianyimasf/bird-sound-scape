Black-and-white seabird with a thick and blunt bill. Breeds in colonies on rocky islands; winters on the ocean. Black above and white below with thin white line in front of eye. In winter, white throat wraps up behind eye, but pattern is less crisp than on Common Murre. Similar to other murres but note different bill shape and longer tail that is sometimes held up. Found singly or in flocks. Sometimes seen from shore in large numbers following the passage of a winter storm. Frequently dives underwater searching for fish.

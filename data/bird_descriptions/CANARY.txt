A small bird of montane forest interior. Olive-green upperparts, yellow underparts, black bill and orange legs. Sallies for insects in the midstory but can also hop around flicking wings and fanning its tail. Somewhat similar to Yellow-legged Flycatcher and White-faced Robin, but Papuan Flycatcher occurs at higher elevation and lacks any white on the face or throat. Voice, a high-pitch, jumbled song or a simple “chip”.

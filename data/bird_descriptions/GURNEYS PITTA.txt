Male has purple-blue crown, bright yellow half-collar, and black-and-yellow underparts. Female has a pale yellow crown and black-barred yellowish breast and belly. Inhabits lowland rainforests, where it forages singly or in pairs in gullies and ditches, often near water. Gives a raptor-like “chiiir!”.

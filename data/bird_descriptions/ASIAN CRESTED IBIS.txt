A white, exotic-looking waterbird with a bright red face and raggedy crest. Adults are washed in gray during the breeding season. Most colorful in flight; underwings are tinged with soft orange. Inhabits paddy fields, wet meadows, and riversides, and breeds in nearby forests. Extremely restricted in range, the bulk of the wild population is restricted to a preserve in Yang’xian in China’s Shaanxi province, though reintroduction programs have been successful in Japan and other parts of China.

An impressive long-tailed cuckoo of densely vegetated woodlands and tall scrub. Note the long straight bill and the bright orange-buff belly. Generally solitary and secretive, but also tame. Sometimes runs on the ground after prey. Flight often consists of long glides on rounded wings. Vocalizations include a loud, long, ratcheting “eh-eh-eh…” and a penetrating “puck-grawwwwwww.”

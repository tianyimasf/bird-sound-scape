Shy and attractive species with a long tail, which can be held cocked. Mostly olive-brown with a rusty nape, a black mask, and a white eyebrow. Note the black collar with a thin white line above that contrasts with its buff face and underparts. Found in grasslands with scattered bushes. The song is a series of far-carrying “chip” notes, repeated continually.

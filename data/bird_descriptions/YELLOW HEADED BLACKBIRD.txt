Stunning and unmistakable blackbird of western North America. Males are black with a golden-yellow head and white patch on the wing. Females are all dark brown with messy yellow on the head and breast. Breeds in marshes, where males sing a grating, mechanical song. Winters in large flocks, mainly in Mexico. Often mixes with other species of blackbird. Forages in open areas, sometimes on barren dirt or in fields.

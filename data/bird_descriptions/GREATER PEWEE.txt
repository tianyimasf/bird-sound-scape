Large, drab flycatcher with spiky crest. Few defining plumage marks; overall brownish-gray with slightly paler belly and faint wingbars. Bill is long with orange lower mandible. Similar to Olive-sided Flycatcher but drabber without contrasting vest. Separated from wood-pewees by crest and longer bill. Native to Mexico and northern Central America; found in mountainous forests, usually with conifers. Limited range in U.S. Often perches conspicuously and sings its clear whistled “Jose Maria” song.

Snappy-looking male is black with a white throat and yellow belly. Two black patches on either side of the chest give him a “vested” appearance. Female is soft brown above with a darker tail and wingtips, and a pale-yellow belly which blends gradually into the breast. The female also has a vest, but it is fainter and less eye-catching than the male’s. Found from lower foothills up into montane areas, where it inhabits open areas with tall growth, particularly edges and clearings. Like other flowerpeckers, favors mistletoe.

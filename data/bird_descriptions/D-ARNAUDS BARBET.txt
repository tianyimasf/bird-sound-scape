A big, conspicuous, colorful barbet with a yellow face and breast that are speckled with black, and a red undertail. There is considerable geographical variation in the amount of black on the crown, throat, and breast band and in the color of the belly, which can be yellow or white. Found on and near the ground in savanna habitats with termite mounds, usually in pairs and small groups. The song is a phrase of three or four notes repeated over and over, often given as a duet. Separated from Yellow-breasted Barbet by the heavily speckled face, and from Red-and-yellow Barbet by the lack of red on the head.
